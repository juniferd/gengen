        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anni_Albers">Anni Albers</a> was a textile artist. I went down a rabbit hole reading and watching videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NgMNvK52A&ab_channel=VictoriaandAlbertMuseum">jacquard loom</a> with its punch card system that makes it a predecessor to modern computing. this exercise takes the js Date object to construct a series of numbers in binary and prints them out. it will forever be changing since one of the numbers is the ever increasing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unix_time">UNIX epoch</a></p>
