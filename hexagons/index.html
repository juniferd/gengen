        they're hexagons. :shrug: found out canvas rotations are always at (0,
        0) and you have to translate the entire context, rotate the entire
        context, then reset everything back. it's a different way of
        thinking/planning. like if you were drawing, but your arm was stuck and
        you had to move and rotate the paper instead of your arm.
