        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a> are a formal grammar introduced by biologist Aristid Lindenmayer. They're recursive in nature with a seed "axiom" and a set of production rules. They can be used to model plants, cells, and other fractal-like forms.</p>
        <p>at some point when i get a chance i want to add controls so you can play around with your own rules, but for now here's a set of systems i've created. some are arbitrary. some are suggested by chatgpt. some are lifted wholesale from <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop">the algorithmic beauty of plants</a></p>
