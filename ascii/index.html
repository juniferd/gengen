        <p>created an image. dynamically convert it to grayscale and redraw in canvas. then generate an ASCII image based on the average grayscale value in an nxn square. (added a random color for funsies) i had to hard-code the ASCII characters used though. originally i was going to try to dynamically generate the gray:ASCII map based on the printed character's percentage of filled in pixels, but ran into issues with SVG in Canvas/Text in Canvas/just me being an idiot.
