        <p>aka messing about with sine waves aka draw a bunch of lines and see what happens aka... yeah i'm not sure.</p>
        <p>for funsies i did try to create a sine wave using a bezier curve for the first drawing (rather than the very naive line segment approach of drawings 2 and 3). it wasn't as exciting as i thought it would be.</p>
